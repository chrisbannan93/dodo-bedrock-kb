Hi <FIRSTNAME>

Your <BRAND> account remains unpaid and we’ve been unable to contact you. Please make a payment of $<AMOUNT> now, to avoid service restriction in <DAYS>.

You can make a payment online now, or via your preferred payment option. If you have made a payment within the last few days, please disregard this email.

What happens if you don’t pay?
If your services are restricted, you’ll no longer be able to make outgoing calls, your data will be slowed down, and you will continue to accrue monthly access charges.

Need extra time or support?
If you are experiencing temporary financial difficulty, we’re here to help. For short term payment assistance, you can reach out to our team on <SUPPORT_NUMBER> for due date extensions, payment plans, or alternative plan options.

If you are facing financial hardship, our Financial Hardship Policy outlines options available to assist you, including long term payment plans, spend controls and financial counselling support. Please submit a financial assistance support request here or call our hardship line on <HARDSHIP_NUMBER>.

Regards
The <BRAND> team
